/*

For loop vs while loops:
1. In a For loop it is known how many times to iterate but in a while loop it is known when to stop the iteration but not always how many iterations.
2. For loop is easier to read than a while loop
3. In some languages it is claimed that one looping method is faster than another. But I have no data to prove that for C++
